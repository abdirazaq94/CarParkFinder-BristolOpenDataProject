## Business Case

### Problem statement
TODO: Replace the example text like this with text that describes your project. What is the problem to be addressed?

Efficient car park management is a key challenge in cities like Bristol due to rising vehicle numbers and limited spaces. This project uses the Open Data Bristol car park dataset to create a web-based car park finder built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app visualises real-time and historical parking data, showing availability, trends, and peak times to help users find parking easily and support data-driven city planning.
