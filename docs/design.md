The filters function on the left support users who want to limit findings on things such as car park type which quickly helps to remove unwanted options. The actual main areaa shown on the wireframe starts of empty but has information to help users navigate and take action. View all results button make sure that users can still see options if they are not sure on which filters to use and what they do.
