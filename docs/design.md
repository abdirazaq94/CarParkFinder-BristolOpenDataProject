TODO: Specify and develop a user interface mockup using a wireframe.




User Interface Design
The user interface is specifically designed to be easily navigated and compatibale with all users regardless of technological experience. The application helps users navigate to find car parks in the city of Bristol, using a map and features such as a live count to show available spaces in car parks and interactive maps to help navigate around areas to find the location of the car park. 

Design Considerations
- End users can search for local car parks by location, Car Park name, prices or spaces available in a car park
- Results of searches are shown on an interactive map with pinpoint markers to show futher details such as spaces that are available, payment methods and opening hours.
- The interface is fully responsive and it adapts to different screen sizes to ensure usability across different devices.
- using high contrast colours and readable font sizes.
- Minimal Interface to reduce clutter ensuring its easy to use while driving.
- Save favourite car parks for quicker access
- Payment Options and Peak time indicators to help avoid busy periods.
